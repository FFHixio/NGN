**NOTICE:**

NGN grew enormously, scattered amongst several repos. We're consolidating as we near a [2.0.0 release](https://github.com/ngnjs/NGN/tree/2.0.0). We've been using NGN 1.x.x in production (clients and our own apps) for a few years, but have held off on a formal public release. Version 2.0.0 will be the first release we publicize. The [project roadmap](https://github.com/ngnjs/ngn/projects/1) is updated as we complete pieces of the revamped library.

We are currently working on:

- Our documentation generator ([metadoc](https://github.com/author/metadoc))
- The [productionline](https://github.com/coreybutler/productionline) build tool
- [Chassis](https://github.com/ngn-chassis) - our PostCSS layout engine.
- A web component library.
- [JET NGN](https://github.com/ngn-jet) - the browser framework we built on NGN.

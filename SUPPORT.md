# Support

Documentation is forthcoming. We intend to release it on [metadoc.io](https://metadoc.io) (a service we are building).

**_Please search for your issue_ before submitting a new one.** It's amazing how many people skip this step. If you actually have a question, consider searching [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) as well.

Our goal is to close every issue and answer every question, but backlog happens. 

## Here's how we prioritize fixes/responses:

1. **Customers First** - If you're a [client](https://butlerlogic.com), sponsoring a maintainer, or have a support contract, your issue receives top priority.<br/><br/>

    > If you have access to a support Slack channel (sponsors), feel free to ask general questions there. If you have encountered a problem, please create an issue here. Issues filed by sponsors are automatically submitted through Slack.

1. **Regression Tested Issues** - If you create a pull request with a regression test illustrating the problem, it will receive higher priority. This takes the guess work out of an issue, allowing efforts to be focused on a fix.
1. **Clearly Defined Issues** - Clearly defined issues with instructions for recreating the problem help reach the "fix" faster.
1. Everything else.
